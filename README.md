# Folio-2023

This was a creative idea for my portfolio (and will probably compromise on it), but it would be memory intensive and fixing all of those errors and performance issues would be extra time consumming! Moreover, I need better visuals!!!

This repo is archived, but a new one (pobably titled folio-2024) will be/is there into by github account. I will be re-creating the whole thing using react-three/fiber, and many things will change on the go.

All in all, thanks for your interest!
